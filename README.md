<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
So this project is about how we can consult them by analyzing this data and use some insights to get there customers back.

<!-- TASKS -->
## Task1
First task is to understand what is going on at the client and think about how you would approach a problem like this to test this specific hypothesis.

Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your LDS, focusing on the potential data that you would need from the client and analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

## Task2
Sub-Task 1:
Clean the data – you might have to address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers.

Sub-Task 2:
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.

## Task3
Sub-task 1: 
Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client

Sub-task 2: 
Build the features in order to get ready to model.

## Task3
Sub-Task 1:
Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables you have constructed in the feature engineering process.

Sub-Task 2:
Evaluate your model, using a holdout set, and with metrics of your choosing. Be sure to pick a metric that would make sense for this business case.

Sub-Task 3:
Interpret the results and use them to formulate your answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions.

## Task4
Sub-Task 1:
Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables you have constructed in the feature engineering process.

Sub-Task 2:
Evaluate your model, using a holdout set, and with metrics of your choosing. Be sure to pick a metric that would make sense for this business case.

Sub-Task 3:
Interpret the results and use them to formulate your answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions.

## Task5
Develop an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the steering committee meeting which the head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.
