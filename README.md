<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
So this project is about how we can consult them by analyzing this data and use some insights to get there customers back.

<!-- TASKS -->
## Task1
Clean the data â€“ you might have to address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers.
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.
